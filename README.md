# chat_box
This is simple app for chat without loging in. It has database with one table that can be easily truncated for maintenance. 
Majority is done by ajax, with little php. It also uses localStorage for customizing background color of the page. If browser
for any reason does not have localStorage, customizing option will be unavailable because it is completely generated by
JavaScript.
